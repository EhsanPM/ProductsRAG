# Fix Applied: ChromaDB Telemetry Error

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The error you encountered:
```
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
```

This is a known compatibility issue with ChromaDB's telemetry feature.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated `product_rag.py`

Added ChromaDB configuration to disable telemetry:

```python
import chromadb

# Disable ChromaDB telemetry to avoid compatibility issues
chromadb.config.Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)
```

And updated both vector store initializations to include client settings:

```python
client_settings = chromadb.config.Settings(
    anonymized_telemetry=False,
    allow_reset=True
)

# Used when creating and loading the vector store
Chroma(
    persist_directory=str(self.chroma_dir),
    embedding_function=self.embeddings,
    client_settings=client_settings
)
```

### 2. Updated `.env.example`

Added telemetry configuration option:
```env
ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
```

### 3. Created Documentation

- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- **test_system.py** - System verification script

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Rebuild Vector Database (Recommended)

```bash
# Delete the existing database
rm -rf chroma_db_openai/

# Run the fixed code to recreate it
poetry run python product_rag.py
```

### Option 2: Test First

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
poetry run python test_system.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Check all dependencies
- ✅ Verify OpenAI API key
- ✅ Test vector database initialization
- ✅ Run a sample query

### Option 3: Run the App

If the test passes, start the Streamlit app:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run app.py
```

## 📋 What to Expect

The telemetry warning should now be completely gone. You should see:

```
✅ All tests passed! System is working correctly.
🚀 You can now run: streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

ChromaDB's telemetry feature has a compatibility issue in certain versions where the `capture()` method signature doesn't match the expected parameters. By disabling telemetry entirely, we avoid this issue without affecting any functionality of the RAG system.

## 💡 Additional Notes

- The fix is already applied to your code
- No functionality is lost by disabling telemetry
- The telemetry was only for ChromaDB usage statistics
- Your RAG system will work exactly the same, just without the error

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

Run this command to test:

```bash
poetry run python test_system.py
```

If you see all green checkmarks (✅), the fix is working!
