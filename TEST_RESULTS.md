### 🚀 Streamlit App Status

**Status:** ✅ **RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY**

```
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.0.26:8501
```

The Streamlit chatbot interface is up and running without errors!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ChromaDB Telemetry Warnings ⚠️

**Status:** Mitigated (warnings visible but not causing failures)

The telemetry warnings still appear in console:
```
Failed to send telemetry event ClientStartEvent...
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent...
```

**Impact:** None - these are just warnings and don't affect functionality.

**Solution Applied:**
- Set `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False` environment variable
- System works perfectly despite warnings
- All operations complete successfully

### 2. Metadata Validation Error ✅

**Status:** FIXED

**Previous Error:**
```
ValueError: Expected metadata value to be a str, int, float or bool, got None
```

**Solution Applied:**
- Filter out None values from metadata
- Provide default values for missing fields:
  - `sku` → 'unknown'
  - `name` → 'Unknown Product'
  - `brandName` → 'Unknown Brand'

**Result:** Vector store created successfully with 4574 products!
